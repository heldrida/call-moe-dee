Call Moe Dee (inspired by Kool Moe Dee, Wild Wild West theme song) is a helper function that make's timed recursive calls, if a given condition does not pass after a given amount of time. When the condition test passes, a callback function is called, terminating it! Also, for each recursive or step in the call stack, there is a stepCallback callback function if required. Hell yeah! No mo' breaking necks guessing when you is able to make those godammit calls!",
